# normality-QF-sketching-apps

Code to reproduce the results from the paper "Inference in Randomized Least Squares and PCA via Normality of Quadratic Forms" by Wang, Zhang and Dobriban.

The methods/ folder includes all functions impleting the methods and simulations.

The main function is sketching_methods.R, which includes all sketching methods for randomized PCA solutions.
   
All results in our paper can be reproduced with the code in experiments/.

The HGDP data can be downloaded from [another GitHub link](https://github.com/dobriban/DPA/blob/master/Experiments/Experiment%2011%20-%20HGDP/hgdp/chr22/hgdp.txt).
